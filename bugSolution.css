The problem is often caused by how the browser interprets the calculation.  Instead of directly subtracting pixels from a percentage, try using a workaround that ensures the calculation is performed accurately. For example, you can use the following solution that avoids directly subtracting pixels from percentages:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
  margin-left: 10px;
  margin-right: 10px;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Important for accurate width calculation */
}
```
This ensures the element's content takes 50% of the available width, and the margins account for the 10px on each side.
